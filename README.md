# Laser-cut case for MiSTer FPGA project

Plans for a laser-cut case for the [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) FPGA project and add-on boards.

There are many options for 3D printed cases for the MiSTer project, but I haven't been able to find many open source plans for those of us with access to a laser cutter. I designed this case to fit my specific configuration of MiSTer: 

* DE10 Nano FPGA board
* IO Board 5.6 XL
* USB Hub 1.2

It should be easy to modify for other configurations.

Materials Supported: any 3mm thickness material (plywood, acrylic etc.). Design requires 1 x A4 sheet of material per case.

Extra brass standoffs will be required in addition to those supplied with the DE-10 Nano and IO boards.

Plans are supplied in Affinity Desinger, SVG and WMF format (WMF works best on my cheap 40W Chinese laser cutter).

# Extra notes from MarTinX
I added a DXF file into the repo with perfect and correct size.  
I tried to conver the SVG into DXF with Adobe Illustrator and it exported wrong size DXF for me, and I cut a giant shell at the moment. (the internal zoom ratio is totally incorrect)  
Now, I just make it with right size now. Have fun with it.
And, 3mm thickness smoked transparent acrylic would be my suggestion.

Here are the right length for rod/pillar and screw you need.
